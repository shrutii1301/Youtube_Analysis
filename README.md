# Stock Analysis of Major Tech Companies

## Project Description

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the stocks of four major tech companies: Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, from 2014 to 2018. The goal of this project is to understand the trends, patterns, and growth of these tech giants over a five-year period, and to provide insights that could potentially guide investment decisions. This project was completed as part of a data analysis portfolio, with the aim to develop a data-driven approach to understanding stock market trends.

## Technology Stack

This project is implemented using Python 3.8, with the following libraries:

- pandas 1.1.5: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy 1.19.5: For numerical computations
- matplotlib 3.3.4: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- seaborn 0.11.1: For statistical data visualization
- plotly 4.14.3: For interactive graphing

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.8 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Set up a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Make sure you are in the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
2. Run the Python script: `python script.py`

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in CSV files, one for each company. Each file contains the following columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Name.

## Results

The script generates a series of plots for each company, showing the closing price and volume of stocks traded over time. It also calculates the daily stock returns and the percentage return. The script also generates pair plots and heatmaps to visualize the correlation between the stocks of different companies.
